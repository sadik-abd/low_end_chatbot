Q: Beneath the cerulean expanse of the sky, the town of Elmsworth buzzed with an energy that only came with the arrival of spring. The streets, once muted by the winter's chill, now echoed with the laughter of children and the rhythmic patter of footsteps. Marcella, a local baker, was particularly excited for this season. Every year, she would craft a new type of pastry, drawing inspiration from the vibrant blooms that dotted the landscape. This year, she had concocted a delicate raspberry tart, infused with hints of rosemary and thyme. The townsfolk eagerly awaited her creation, knowing that it would be another testament to Marcella's culinary prowess.
